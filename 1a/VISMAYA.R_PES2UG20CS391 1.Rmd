## Solutions

### Load the Dataset

``` r
library(tidyverse)
# Remember: You need to install tidyverse package to load it!
df <- read_csv("top_1000_instagrammers.csv")
```

### Problem 1

### CODE-1

``` {r,echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("top_1000_instagrammers.csv")

chartonum<-function(col){
  num_col <- seq(1,1000)
  
  for(i in 1:length(col)) {
    len<-nchar(col[i])
    if(substring(col[i],len,len+1)=="M"){
      temp<-substring(col[i],1,len-1)

### OUTPUT SCREENSHOT

### ANALYSIS

All the 3 data columns show a positively skewed distribution as the mean
is greater than the median.This means the outliers of the distribution
are further out towards the right and closer to the mean on the left

The minimum value is zero in Authentic Engagement but non-zero in the
other two, this means that you can be a top Instagram influencer with
zero Authentic Engagement as long as maintain your followers count by
there is average engagement from the users' side.

As we compare standard deviation values, we find out that the Followers
values is the one with the most variations, followed by Engagement
Average and then Authentic Engagement.

Also, the Inter Quartile Range of "Followers" data is quite high
compared to the other two, this means that the Top Instagram Influencers
depict a very wide range of Followers count, while the Engagement
Average and Authentic Engagement values are comparatively similar.

### Problem 2

### CODE-2

``` {r,echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("top_1000_instagrammers.csv")

chartonum<-function(col){
  
  num_col <- seq(1,1000)
  
  for(i in 1:length(col)) {
    len<-nchar(col[i])
    
    if(substring(col[i],len,len+1)=="M"){
      temp<-substring(col[i],1,len-1)
      temp<-as.double(temp)
      temp<-temp*1000000
      num_col[i]<-temp
    } 
    
    if(substring(col[i],len,len+1)=="K"){
      temp<-substring(col[i],1,len-1)
      temp<-as.double(temp)
      temp<-temp*1000
      num_col[i]<-temp
    }
    
    if(col[i]=="0"){
      num_col[i]<-0
    }
    
    
  }#for loop ends
  
  
  return(num_col)
}

col_AC<-df$'Audience Country'
col_Fo<-chartonum(df$Followers)

Fcounts<-c()
countries<-c()

for(i in 1:length(col_AC)){
  
  if(!(is.na(col_AC[i])) && col_AC[i] %in% countries){
   Fcounts[which(countries==col_AC[i])]<-Fcounts[which(countries==col_AC[i])]+col_Fo[i]
  }
  
  else if(!(is.na(col_AC[i])) && !(col_AC[i] %in% names(Fcounts))){
   countries<-append(countries,col_AC[i])
   Fcounts<-append(Fcounts,col_Fo[i])
    }
}

barplot(Fcounts , names.arg=countries ,cex.lab=1.3,cex=0.5,cex.axis=0.9,las=2, main="Barplot:Audience Country vs No. of Followers from that country" ,xlab="Audience Country",ylab="No. of Followers")
```

### OUTPUT SCREENSHOT

![](images/Problem2.png)

### ANALYSIS

From the tallest bar in the bargraph it is clear that The United States
has the most amount of followers ,which is about 9 Billion. India ranks
second with about 5 Billion Followers. This can be attributed to the
fact that in Inida, Instagram is mostly used by the younger generation
of the age group 18-25 as older generation people are still facebook
savy, unlike The United States where it is quite popular among a lot of
different age groups.So, even though India has more population, it only
has half the Instagram followers as compared to the US.

### Problem 3

### CODE-3

```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("top_1000_instagrammers.csv")

chartonum<-function(col){
  num_col <- seq(1,1000)
  for(i in 1:length(col)) {
    len<-nchar(col[i])
  
    if(substring(col[i],len,len+1)=="M"){
      temp<-substring(col[i],1,len-1)
      temp<-as.double(temp)
      temp<-temp*1000000
      num_col[i]<-temp
    } 
    
    if(substring(col[i],len,len+1)=="K"){
      temp<-substring(col[i],1,len-1)
      temp<-as.double(temp)
      temp<-temp*1000
      num_col[i]<-temp
    }
    
    if(col[i]=="0"){
      num_col[i]<-0
    }
    
    
  }
  return(num_col)
}

df$num_AuthEng <-chartonum(df$`Authentic Engagement`)
boxplot(df$num_AuthEng,horizontal=TRUE,main = "Horizontal Boxplot of Authentic Engagement")

```

### OUTPUT SCREENSHOT

![](images/Problem3.png)

### ANALYSIS

In the above figure, the Authentic Engagement values are skewed right.
That is,the boxplot is positively skewed. The part of the box to the
left of the median (representing the lesser values) is shorter than the
part to the right of the median (representing the larger values). That
means the Authentic Engagement values of the lower rank influencers are
closer together than the values of the higher ones. This indicates that
while the lower rank influencers maintain a similar level of Authentic
Engagement,the ones in the higher ranks are more varied. There are also
a lot of unusually high Authentic Engagement values in the higher rank
section as evident by the outliers. This is a indication of the
snowballing effect of popularity found in Influencers which also makes
it harder for a newer influencers to emerge.

### Conclusion

My Instagram profile has around 400 followers with estimated engagement
of around 150. It falls under the category of "Lifestyle". Comparing my
account to the analysis, the category of my account is not as popular
compared to the categories of the top influencers such as "Sports with a
ball" and "Music". Also, even though they already have a high followers
count, the top influencers still maintain a high amount of Authentic
Engagement with the users, which eventually in return increases both
their user engagement and followers count, this means that they put in a
lot of effort into their accounts unlike me. Also, they constantly come
up with new trends and ideas to keep their followers engaged.

If I was tasked to becoming an influencer then I would start by honing a
unique bio and a recognisable username .Picking a niche which represents
you is very important. As seen by the analysis of the dataset, all the
top instagram influencers are the people with accounts in their own
fields of expertise. As high-quality content help influencers earn a
reputation regardless of the format of the content, it is necessary to
use powerful video and photo editing tools. Next comes the regular
publishing of the content which could turn a casual viewer into a
follower. After setting everything up, there must be regular interaction
with the followers to help increase user engagement.
